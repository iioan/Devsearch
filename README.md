# Project Name: Devsearch

Welcome to the **Devsearch**! This is a web application built with Django and Python for developers to connect, share and collaborate on projects. 

### Important 
- Templates for frontend were taken from [divanov11/Django-2021](https://github.com/divanov11/Django-2021)
- See the full course here: https://dennisivy.teachable.com/p/django-beginners-course

### Features
- Sign up and login
- Upload projects with description and links to source code
- Send messages to other developers
- Give feedback on uploaded projects

### Project Finished
After my August update:
- Users are able give feedback (Up Vote, Down Vote and Comments) to other published projects
- Search function has been implemented for both projects and developers
- For enhancing users' experience, I added pagination for projects and developers
- Now everyone, even non-users of devsearch, are capable of sending messages to the registered developers
